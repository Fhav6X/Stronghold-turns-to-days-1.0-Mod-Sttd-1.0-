# Stronghold turns to days Mod (Sttd 1.1)
Stronghold mod for Pillars of Eternity

What does it do?
- This mod switches the turn based taxing, "adventure spawn" and "ingredients spawn" to day based.
- I kept adventure completion and "visitor killed" events turn based for logical reason.
- Anything else (Attacks, Visitors) have been day based from the start.

Taxing is now every 5 days and ingredients spawn every 24 hour (work in progress). Adventures are random events now.

How to install?
- Just extract the archive into the main Pillars of Eternity folder.
