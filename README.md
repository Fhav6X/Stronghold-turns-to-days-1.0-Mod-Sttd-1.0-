# Stronghold turns to days Mod (Sttd 1.2)
Stronghold turns to days 1.2 Mod (Sttd 1.2)

What does it do?
- This mod switches the turn based taxing, adventure spawn and ingredients spawn to day based.
- I kept "visitor killed" events turn based for logical reason.
- Anything else (Attacks, Visitors) have been day based from the start.

Taxing is now every 5 days and ingredients spawn every 24 hour. Adventures spawn roughly every 8 to 16 days. Determination of Adventure type is set about 10 days before adventure spawns.

How to install?
- Just extract the archive into the main Pillars of Eternity folder.
