# Stronghold-turns-to-days-1.0-Mod-Sttd-1.0-
Stronghold mod for Pillars of Eternity

What does it do?
- This mod switches the turn based taxing and "ingredients spawn" to day based.
- I kept adventures and "visitor killed" events turn based for logical reason.
- Anything else (Attacks, Visitors) have been day based from the start.

Taxing is now every 5 days and ingredients spawn every 24 hour (work in progress)

How to install?
- Just extract the archive into the main Pillars of Eternity folder.
